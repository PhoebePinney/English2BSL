I'll throw out the garbage
I don't honestly like that kind of stuff
What's wrong with that
Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for
Not for me, Dick
Now he's eating me out of house and home
He makes himself at home, which is fine
That was the last straw
I'll keep you informed
Would you mind waiting a while
Well, how long will it be
But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can
Are you going to the annual party
I can give you a ride if you need one
That's the favor I was going to ask you for
The pleasure is mine
Isn't he the best instructor
I think he's so hot
I really feel energized, don't you
I swear, I'm going to kill you for this
Didn't you think it was fun
I had a blast
Sorry, I'm just not into this health kick
Oh, no, get off it
It wasn't such a killer class
You just have to get into it
Like they say, no pain, no gain
I am wiped out
But thank you for inviting me
You'll feel better after we hit the showers
Could she have something else instead
How about spaghetti with clams and shrimps
Can you manage chopsticks
How do you like our Chinese food
You see, I am already putting on weight
What's wrong with MSG
It helps to bring out the taste of the food
Oh, don't let that worry you
Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables
I don't know exactly
Maybe it's for sanitary reasons
Okay, let's go home
Do you have a reservation
How many of you, please
Six, including two kids
I'm afraid all the big tables are taken
What kind of food do you like
I like Chinese food
Would you care for a drink before you order
A glass of Qingdao beer
I'll bring it over
Have you decided what you'd like, sir
Will you make some recommendation
Can I help you sir, what do you need
I need a packet of cigarettes please
Of course sir, no problem
Could I have my bill, please
I'm afraid there's been a mistake
What seems to be the trouble
I'll just go and check it for you, sir
May I sit here
Is everything to your satisfaction
Sorry to hear that
It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it
Do you wish to try something else
That would be on the house, of course
I'm looking for a white purse as a gift
Could you show what you have in stock
You are in luck
They must be popular again this season
Yes, I believe they are
Here are something that might interest you
I'll take this one
Let me ring this up for you at the register
How can I help you
Where is your store located
We are on Nanjing Road, next to the theatre
Right, I'll be right over
Thank you, I know where that is
May I help you find something, sir
You have good taste
Let my show you what I have
Would you like a lift home
That would be great
Can I help you
Yes, how do I get to your shop from Chilin
Thank you very much
I think I going to need some iced water too
Is there an extra charge for that
Yes, we charge 50 cents for water
Could you give me some more napkins, too
Do you need anything else
I'll put all that into the bag for you
No, there is no charge for those
I'm looking for some blush
Do you still have some in peach rose
Oh, yes, that is a beautiful color
It has been very popular blush this season
I have two left
Great, I'll take one
Wow, that sounds like a bargain
I'd be glad to
Do you need anything else
Oh, I almost forgot
It's my mum's birthday Saturday
I need to get her some more Chanel
That would be my pleasure
Golden Taxi cabs, how may I help you
Can you send a cab to pick me up
Sure, where are you
I'm on the corner of the Fifth and Mane
OK, I'm sorry it took so long
Some days are just like that
Hello, I need to get a cab
There is about a 15 - minute wait
Give me your address
Is Tom available please
He'll be right with you
Hi Bill, it's Jane
OK, I'll be right back
Looks like dinner's ready
May I try on this dress
I made my little brother cry
Can I have the check please
Is this amount correct
Yes, sir, it is
Are you through with your meal
Could we have the check please
Do you accept checks
No, I'm sorry we don't
We accept credit cards and cash
Thank you, I'll be right back
Do you need any to go boxes
Yes, we do, thank you
Could you show me what you have
How high of a heel do you want
Do you have any in a size six
I'm just looking for a black pair
Let me go to the back and get them
I'll be right back
I'm just so touched by the sad story
Which scene is your favorite
I love them all
You know, I couldn't help falling asleep
I didn't notice that
I mean falling asleep
For me, this one is not that attractive
Then I doubt if you like operas at all
I like Carmen very much
